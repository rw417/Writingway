# Summary Feature Overhaul - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Disabled Old Chapter/Act Summary Features

**Files Renamed (Disabled):**
- `project_window/summary_controller.py` → `summary_controller.py.bak`
- `project_window/summary_model.py` → `summary_model.py.bak`
- `project_window/summary_service.py` → `summary_service.py.bak`

**Files Modified to Remove References:**
- `project_window/right_stack.py`:
  - Commented out imports of `SummaryController` and `SummaryModel`
  - Removed `summary_controller` initialization and connections
  - Simplified `create_summary_panel()` to just show a label
  - Removed `_start_summary()` and `_update_summary_mode_visibility()` methods

- `project_window/project_window.py`:
  - Commented out `summary_controller.progress_updated` connection
  - Commented out `summary_controller.create_summary()` call in retry logic

### 2. Scene Summary Feature Implementation

**New Functionality:**
- Scene summaries are now stored in the `"summary"` field of each scene's dictionary in the project structure JSON
- The `scene_summary_edit` text box (already existing in `llm_panel.py`) is now connected to save/load scene summaries

**Files Modified:**

#### `project_window/project_window.py`

**Added Methods:**
- `_build_chapter_summary(chapter_item)`: Builds a combined read-only summary from all scene summaries in a chapter
  - Format: `scene name\nscene summary\n\nscene name\nscene summary...`
  
- `_save_scene_summary(hierarchy)`: Saves the text from `scene_summary_edit` to the scene's dictionary
  
- `_on_scene_summary_changed()`: Auto-saves scene summary when the text changes

**Modified Methods:**
- `load_current_item_content()`:
  - **For scenes (level >= 2)**: Loads scene content AND scene summary into `scene_summary_edit` (with signal blocking to prevent auto-save during load)
  - **For chapters (level == 1)**: Makes editor read-only and displays combined scene summaries
  - **For acts (level == 0)**: Loads act summary normally (editable)

- `manual_save_scene()`: Now also saves scene summary when saving a scene

- `autosave_scene()`: Now also saves scene summary when auto-saving a scene

- `setup_connections()`: Connected `scene_summary_edit.textChanged` to `_on_scene_summary_changed()`

### 3. Chapter Summary Changes

**Behavior:**
- Chapter summaries are now **read-only** (editor is set to read-only mode)
- Content is automatically generated by combining scene summaries from all scenes in the chapter
- Format:
  ```
  Scene 1
  <scene 1 summary text>
  
  Scene 2
  <scene 2 summary text>
  
  ...
  ```
- If no scene summaries exist, displays placeholder: "No scene summaries available for {chapter name}"

### 4. Data Structure

**Scene Dictionary Structure (in `*_structure.json`):**
```json
{
  "name": "Scene 1",
  "uuid": "...",
  "latest_file": "...",
  "summary": "Text of the scene summary"  // NEW FIELD
}
```

**Chapter Dictionary Structure:**
- The `"summary"` field previously stored at chapter level is no longer used for display
- Chapter summary view is dynamically generated from scene summaries

**Act Dictionary Structure:**
- Unchanged - acts still have editable summary fields

## How to Use the New Features

### As a User:

1. **Scene Summaries:**
   - Select a scene in the project tree
   - Type your summary in the `scene_summary_edit` text box (top of the right panel)
   - Summary is automatically saved as you type
   - Summary is also saved when you manually save or auto-save the scene

2. **Chapter Summaries:**
   - Select a chapter in the project tree
   - The main editor shows a read-only view combining all scene summaries
   - To edit summaries, edit individual scenes
   - Format: Each scene's name followed by its summary, separated by blank lines

3. **Act Summaries:**
   - Select an act in the project tree
   - Act summary remains editable in the main editor (unchanged from previous behavior)

## Technical Notes

- Scene summaries are stored directly in the structure JSON file
- Signal blocking is used when loading summaries to prevent unnecessary save operations
- The `_get_node_by_hierarchy()` method is used to access scene nodes for reading/writing summaries
- `save_structure()` is called after updating summaries to persist changes

## Files Affected

**Modified:**
- `project_window/project_window.py`
- `project_window/right_stack.py`

**Disabled (renamed to .bak):**
- `project_window/summary_controller.py.bak`
- `project_window/summary_model.py.bak`
- `project_window/summary_service.py.bak`

**Unchanged but relevant:**
- `project_window/llm_panel.py` (already had `scene_summary_edit`)
- `project_window/project_model.py` (already had structure save methods)
